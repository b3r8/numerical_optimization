Main algorithm: Steepest Descent
Other algorithms used: Line Search and Zoom algorithm
Stopping criteria: Gradient norm < tolerance

Problem to solve: min f(x) = (cx1-2)^4 + (x2^2)(cx1-2)^2 + (x2+1)^2, with
Optimal xmin: [2/c, -1] (where c is a given value, see .m file)
f(xmin) = 0

Main results: convergence plots in folder (.png files)
