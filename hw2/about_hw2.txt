Main algorithm: Conjugate Gradient (CG)
Other algorithms used: Fletcher-Reeves (FR), Polak-Ribiere (PR), Fletcher-Reeves with restart (FR-r)
Stopping criteria: residual < tolerance

Problem to solve for CG: linear system Ax=b, where b is a random vector and A is
  - option 1) a random matrix with uniformly distributed eigenvalues
  - option 2) clustered eigenvalues (see code)
  
Problem to solve for FR, PR, FR-r: min f(x), with
  Optimal x*: 
  f(x*) = 

Main results: convergence plots in folder (.png files)
