Main algorithm: Conjugate Gradient (CG)
Other algorithms used: Fletcher-Reeves (FR), Polak-Ribiere (PR), Fletcher-Reeves with restart (FR-r)
Stopping criteria: residual < tolerance

Problem to solve for CG: linear system Ax=b (or equivalently, quadratic optimization problem min f(x)=1/2x'Ax-bx), where b is a random vector and A is
  - option 1) a random matrix with uniformly distributed eigenvalues
  - option 2) a random matrix with clustered eigenvalues (see code)
  
Problem to solve for FR, PR, FR-r: min f(x) = sum(100(xi^2 - x_{i+1})^2 + (xi - 1)^2), 1 <= i <= n-1
  Optimal xmin: vector of ones
  f(xmin) = 0

Main results: convergence plots in folder (.png files)
