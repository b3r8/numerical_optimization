Main algorithm: L-BFGS
Other algorithms used: Line Search, Zoom algorithm and two-loop recursion subalgorithm
Stopping criteria: error < tolerance

Problem to solve: min f(x) = sum(alphaf(x_{2i} - x_{2i-1}^2)^2 + (1 - x_{2i-1})^2), 1 <= i <= n/2
  Optimal xmin: vector of ones
  f(xmin) = 0

Main results: convergence plots in folder (.png files)
